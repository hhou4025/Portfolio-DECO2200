          <p>Axle is a leading interface solution for autonomous agriculture. In its current form, it is designed for tractor implementation only, however further agricultural vehicles are intended to be made available in the future. The main idea behind the Axle interface is that it is compatible for use with existing vehicles rather than requiring a user to purchase a new vehicle. Users simply connect their tractor to their own personal devices and can begin setting tasks for the vehicles to complete. Obviously, the way in which the interface links to the vehicle is another matter in itself, sequentially this project only dealt with the interactive component.

          <p>At its current rate, the agricultural workforce will not be sufficient enough to supply the demands of the increasing population. While incentives to grow the farming, workforce have proved somewhat helpful, they are far from sufficient to deal with this problem. Therefore, it has become apparent that there is only one viable answerâ€¦. Autonomous Farming.

          <p>While this technology exists, the ease of user interaction is far from desirable. We conducted significant research as a group to establish the foundations of our solution. To achieve this, we combined a range of qualitative and quantitative methods as illustrated in the diagram below:

          <p>We learnt from our research that there was a preferential desire for tractor controls over other farm vehicles. We also learnt there was a significant need for tracking and monitoring features. Notably, a desire to integrate autonomous vehicle controls with other aspects of automated farming was made apparent. However, in order to remain within the scope of the project we decided to only deal with vehicles.

          <p>The primary issues we encountered when iterating was balancing out the required functions.

          <p>Overall, when looking at this project in retrospect, we see that we managed to achieve our directive of simplifying the agricultural process via vehicle control. However, since this was such a broad area to deal with, there are still so many areas that can be improved and developed further. When examining this objectively, we would have preferred more time in the research phase in order to extract stronger responses and insights from associated individuals. Because of this we are now firmly aware of the need to be able to conduct rapid research methods, especially when strict time restrictions are present. The importance of simplifying all interactions was another prevalent theme we were made aware of through this process.
